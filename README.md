How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
JUnit tests are an excellent way to ensure the software works as intended. Additionally, incorporating security best practices, 
such as input validation and secure coding standards, is essential to make sure the program is secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks. I start with the simplest problems and gradually
work my way up to more complex issues to ensure each need is addressed.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by breaking everything into smaller, manageable problems. I also research reliable documentation to 
fully understand the topic and ensure Iâ€™m using the right tools and techniques.
